<p> London is home to some of the most famous sights in the world, attracting millions of visitors every year. One of the best-known landmarks is the Tower of London, a historic fortress that once served as a royal residence, prison, and treasury. Today, it houses the Crown Jewels and offers a vivid look into the city’s medieval past. Nearby stands the iconic Tower Bridge, whose twin towers and lifting bascules make it one of the most photographed structures in the city. </p>
 <p> Another major attraction is Buckingham Palace, the official residence of the British monarch. Visitors often gather to watch the Changing of the Guard, a traditional ceremony that showcases the precision and pageantry of the Royal Guard. Not far away lies the Palace of Westminster with its famous clock tower, commonly known as Big Ben. Together with the Houses of Parliament, it forms one of the most recognizable silhouettes along the River Thames. </p> 
 <p> Modern London also offers impressive sights. The London Eye, a giant Ferris wheel on the South Bank, provides panoramic views over the city and has become a symbol of contemporary London. The Shard, the tallest building in the United Kingdom, offers observation decks that allow visitors to see the city from more than 300 meters above ground. These modern landmarks stand in striking contrast to the city’s historic architecture. </p> 
 <p> London’s cultural attractions are equally remarkable. The British Museum, home to artifacts from around the world, is one of the most visited museums globally and offers free admission. The Tate Modern, located in a former power station, showcases contemporary art and has become a cultural hotspot. For theatre lovers, the West End is a must-see, offering world-class musicals and plays every night. </p> 
 <p> Beyond the major landmarks, London’s neighborhoods also offer unique sights. Camden Market, Covent Garden, and Notting Hill each have their own charm, from colorful houses to lively street performances. Parks such as Hyde Park and Regent’s Park provide green spaces in the heart of the city, making London a place where history, culture, and nature come together in a unique way. </p>
