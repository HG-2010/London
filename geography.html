<p> London is located in the southeast of England and lies along the River Thames, which flows through the city for more than 50 kilometers. The river has shaped London’s development for centuries, serving as a major transport route and influencing the layout of the city. London sits in a broad, low-lying basin known as the London Basin, surrounded by gentle hills such as Hampstead Heath in the north and the North Downs further south. These natural elevations offer views over the city and mark the edges of the metropolitan area. </p> 

<p> The city covers more than 1,500 square kilometers, making it one of the largest urban areas in Europe. London is divided into 32 boroughs plus the historic City of London, each with its own character and landscape. The central areas are densely built, while the outer boroughs include large parks, forests, and residential neighborhoods. London’s green spaces are a defining feature of its geography: Hyde Park, Richmond Park, and Hampstead Heath are just a few examples of the many parks that give the city an unusually high amount of open space for a major metropolis. </p> 

<p> London’s climate is classified as temperate maritime, meaning mild temperatures, moderate rainfall, and relatively small seasonal variations. Winters are cool but rarely extremely cold, while summers are warm without being excessively hot. The proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and the influence of the Gulf Stream help keep temperatures stable throughout the year. Rainfall is spread fairly evenly across the seasons, contributing to the city’s lush vegetation. </p>

 <p> The geography of London also reflects its long history of expansion. The original settlement grew around the Thames, but over time the city spread outward in all directions. Today, London’s metropolitan area blends into surrounding counties such as Surrey, Kent, Essex, and Hertfordshire. Despite its size, the city maintains a balance between urban development and natural landscapes, making its geography both diverse and distinctive. </p>
